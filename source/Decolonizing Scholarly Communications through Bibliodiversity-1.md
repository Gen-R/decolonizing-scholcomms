## ABSTRACT

Diversity is an important characteristic of any healthy ecosystem. In the field
of scholarly communications, diversity in services and platforms, funding
mechanisms and evaluation measures will allow the ecosystem to accommodate the
different workflows, languages, publication outputs and research topics that
support the needs of different research communities. Diversity also reduces the
risk of vendor lock-in, which leads to monopolization and high prices. Yet this
‘bibliodiversity’ is undermined by the fact that researchers around the world
are evaluated according to journal-based citation measures, which have become
the major currency of academic research. Journals seek to maximize their
bibliometric measures by adopting editorial policies that increase citation
counts, resulting in the predominance of Northern/Western research priorities
and perspectives in the literature, and an increasing marginalization of
research topics of more narrow or local nature. This contribution examines the
distinctive, non-commercial approach to open access (OA) found in Latin America
and reflects on how greater diversity in OA infrastructures helps to address
inequalities in global knowledge production as well as knowledge access. The
authors argue that bibliodiversity, rather than adoption of standardized models
of OA, is central to the development of a more equitable system of knowledge
production.

## Introduction: Concentration vs Bibliodiversity in Scholarly Publishing

The original vision of the World Wide Web was of a highly distributed
environment; a place where all individuals could contribute and access
information at any time. However, like many other aspects of the Internet, the
services in scholarly communications have become increasingly consolidated over
the years, bringing us to the current state in which scholarly communications is
now dominated by a handful of large commercial providers, with the top five
publishers controlling much of the market, while accruing huge profits.[^1]

[^1]: The top five publishers, who control over 50 per cent of the market and
    above 70 per cent in some disciplines, have profit margins in the order of
    28–38.9 per cent (Larivière et al., 2015).

The consolidation of the publishing industry has had a negative impact on
scholarly communications. Most obviously, it has led to very high prices for
commercial journals and a trend of excessive increases that has been going on
for three decades. For example, from 2011 to 2015, the subscription prices of
academic journals rose about 5–7 per cent per year, approximately 25 per cent
over the four-year period (Larivière et al., 2015), with similar increases
experienced in 2016–18. This situation has ramifications for academic library
budgets around the world but is being felt most acutely in lower-income
countries, where funds for subscriptions are at best modest and often minimal.
Many well-resourced libraries have responded to funding shortfalls by moving
money away from smaller journals, monographs and databases, while others with
more limited budgets have had no choice but to cancel subscriptions altogether
(CARL, 2016).

Less often discussed, but equally important, is how the concentration of
publishing services is affecting the diversity of the scholarly communications
system, often referred to as bibliodiversity. Diversity is an important
characteristic of any healthy ecosystem, including scholarly communications.
Diversity in services and platforms, funding mechanisms and evaluation measures
will allow the ecosystem to accommodate the different workflows, languages,
publication outputs and research topics that support the needs of different
research communities. In addition, diversity reduces the risk of vendor lock-in,
which inevitably leads to monopolization and high prices (Shearer et al., 2020).
In a recent blog post on the London School of Economics *Impact of Social
Sciences* blog, Elea Giménez Toledo*,* Emanuel Kulczycki*,* Janne Pölönen and
Gunnar Sivertsen argue that ‘bibliodiversity … both at the national and
international level is essential for preserving research in a wide range of
global and local topics, studied from different epistemic and methodological
approaches, inspired by various schools of thought and expressed in a variety of
languages’ (Giménez Toledo et al., 2019).

One of the main factors impeding bibliodiversity is that researchers around the
world are evaluated according to journal-based citation measures, which have
become the major currency of academic research. Journals seek to maximize their
bibliometric measures by adopting editorial policies that increase citation
counts by publishing ‘hot’ topics, changing the language of their journal to
English, and covering issues of global interest (Bartoli and Medvet, 2013; see
also American Society for Cell Biology, 2013). This, in turn, has resulted in a
predominance of Northern/Western research priorities and perspectives reflected
in the literature, and an increasing marginalization of research topics of more
narrow or local nature. Thus, scholarly communications today functions in a
colonized manner, compelling researchers around the world to undertake research
of importance to the global North, rather than address the issues that are most
relevant in their own regional and local contexts. The value system for
research, developed in the Western and Northern context, has been imposed on all
researchers and has created implicit (and sometimes explicit) negative biases
against researchers in developing countries.[^2]

[^2]: As an example, a blog post in 2015 compared Latin American publishing
    platforms to favelas (Alperin et al., 2015).

This thought piece examines the distinctive, non-commercial approach to open
access (OA) found in Latin America and reflects on how greater diversity in OA
infrastructures helps to address inequalities in global knowledge production as
well as knowledge access. We argue that bibliodiversity, rather than adoption of
standardized models of OA, is central to the development of a more equitable
system of knowledge production.

## Latin America’s Non-Commercial Scholarly Communications Infrastructures

Latin America has charted its own course for scholarly communications and is one
of the world’s most progressive regions in terms of supporting sustainable,
cooperative models for disseminating research — models that ensure that
researchers and citizens have access to the results of research conducted in
their region and often in their own language. In Latin America, scholarly
publishing is based on the concept of ‘science as a commons’, that is,
inherently academy-owned, non-profit and open access. Each academic institution,
de facto, is part of a cooperative system that is neither formalized nor made
explicit. There is a tradition of academic editors running journals and
performing these activities as part of their academic work. As a community, they
create networks of training and discussion in which they reflect on editorial
practices, supporting the complex system that runs scientific publishing but
also approaching publishing as a subject of study, discussion and development.
In this regional system, platforms and journal portals play a key role, as a set
of entities that contribute to the sustainability and visibility of journals,
providing quality assurance, journal production software, services of
interoperability, metrics and training. As Dominique Babini points out: ‘our
strength in Latin America is that we are where the commercial publishing
industry wants to reach: we have scientific communications managed by the same
scientific community, in collaborative ways, without commercial outsourcing’
(Babini, 2019).

Latin America has historically followed a non-commercial OA model that has
operated without charges, either to read or publish, and has been principally
financed with public funds destined for education and research, in much the same
way that other types of research infrastructure are funded. This approach is in
contrast with the Northern scholarly publishing system which has been (mainly)
commercialized and therefore relies on transactional models, through
subscriptions and/or through Article Processing Charges (APCs). In the Latin
American context, there are a number of non-commercial platforms which provide
publishing functionalities and promote the visibility and discoverability of
Latin American research output. Regional directories like Latindex and LA
Referencia and publishing platforms such as Redalyc and SciELO have had a major
impact on the development of Latin American and Caribbean journals (Delgado,
2011). The SciELO Program, a pioneering cooperative platform that was launched
in 1998 to host Brazilian journals, has since been expanded to 15 other
countries in Latin America, Europe and South Africa. SciELO promotes the
integration of quality journals and the research they communicate in the global
flow of scientific information, thus contributing to strengthening and expanding
the visibility, impact and credibility of the research (SciELO Program, 2018).
Redalyc, another non-commercial platform for Latin American journals, started in
2003 with the goal of increasing the visibility of scientific journals published
in the region. Today, Redalyc’s collection contains more than half a million
full-text articles from 1,360 OA peer-reviewed journals published by 670
publisher institutions from 31 countries. It also provides free access to
technology for editorial workflow and electronic journal production to
contribute to the sustainability of non-APC OA journals (Becerril-García and
Aguado-López, 2018). More recently, a coordinated effort emerged in the Latin
American region, called AmeliCA — a cooperative infrastructure for scholarly
publishing and open science with a non-profit publishing model aiming to
preserve the open nature of scientific communications in Latin America.[^3]

[^3]: See the website: [http://amelica.org]()

Despite the fact that Latin America has been a leader in developing local and
regional infrastructures and services for scholarly communications, the region’s
publishing venues are still considered to have a lower prestige value by
researchers and other stakeholders and there is a common misconception that the
regional publishing venues are of lower quality than the so-called international
journals. This perception seems to persist for local, regional and national
journals in other developing countries and regions, regardless of the editorial
practices of the journal or the sophistication of the services provided. This
demonstrates the need for research assessment systems to move beyond
publication-based metrics, in which publishing from the North — and particularly
in for-profit publishing venues — has an advantage, towards a more comprehensive
assessment of the quality of research output.

## Open Access Models and Global Inequalities in Knowledge Production

The open access and open scholarship (also referred to as open science)
movements aspire to redress some of the inequalities of access to knowledge
around the world. Open access, which is primarily focused on free and immediate
access and re-use of research articles, has been steadily gaining momentum since
the Budapest Open Access Initiative Declaration in 2002[^4], with approximately
30% of the total published research articles now available in open access format
(Piwowar et al., 2019). Open scholarship/open science extends the concept of
openness beyond the research article to include a wide range of research
outputs.

[^4]: See: https://[www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read]()

But openness in scholarship is about more than just increasing readership and
use. It is about democratization of knowledge. In the words of Sarita Albagli, a
researcher from the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology
(IBICT):

>   The present planetary crisis, in its various dimensions, still imposes new
>   agendas on open science. The urgency and complexity in confronting it shows
>   a crisis of solutions, pointing to the need for new ways of approaching
>   problems, new knowledge bases, and other ways of producing science and
>   innovating. It is also a crisis of representation: more sustainable routes
>   to development imply radically democratic processes in their multiple
>   possibilities and meanings, as well as in the scientific-technological paths
>   to be adopted. (Albagli, 2017)

As the community transitions to full and complete open access and open science,
there is a risk that the model of APCs will dominate and will perpetuate or even
exacerbate the current problems of Western/Northern bias in scholarly
communications. As Angela Okune points out in a blog post about decolonizing
scholarly data and publishing infrastructures, ‘[d]espite the revolutionary
rhetoric, it appears that much of the mainstream Open Science movement continues
to operate under the same values and structures of the pre-crisis era, albeit
with new tools and norms to revitalise its credibility’ (Okune, 2019). Of
particular concern is the potential for a large-scale shift from ‘pay to access’
to ‘pay to publish’, through what are called transformational agreements, which
could mean that researchers in developing countries and less-resourced domains
and institutions will find it even more difficult to publish their research. As
Poynder notes, this means that researchers from the global South would be
excluded in a different (but more pernicious) way than they are under the
subscription system: free to read research published in international journals
but unable to publish in them (Poynder, 2019). In Latin America, numerous
organizations have publicly expressed their position that such a flip from
subscriptions to open access agreements with commercial publishers will have a
negative impact on the research communities and also on the existing
non-commercial infrastructures that have been developed over recent years
(AmeliCA, 2019; CLACSO, 2019; First Consortium Assembly from Ibero-America and
the Caribbean, 2017; Redalyc, 2019). Unfortunately, this concern — articulated
consistently by different stakeholders in developing countries — has largely
fallen on deaf ears among those who are advancing the model of flipping from
subscriptions to OA.

Moreover, ‘pay to publish’ models do not return the expenditure on publishing
back into the research cycle. The non-profit, academic OA model promoted by
Latin America has been shown to be sustainable and much less expensive (Banzato
and Rozemblum, 2019), and it keeps the money invested in the academic sector. In
developing countries, where research funding is scarce and government funding
for research is relatively low, there is an urgent need to keep the current
economic resources in the scientific communications system, either to strengthen
publishing or for research. As such, there is a conflict between the needs of
the global South and the direction of the elite Northern research and publishing
framework. A system based on pay-to-publish deals will further disenfranchise
researchers in the global South and risks deepening existing inequality and
exclusion (Mudditt, 2019). From a geopolitical perspective, there are
fundamental differences in the approaches to scientific publishing and scholarly
publications; while they appear to be treated as a commodity prone to
commercialization in the global North, in Latin America, publishing is conceived
of as the community sharing of public goods (Debat and Babini, 2019).

On the other hand, the transition towards openness also presents an opportunity
to reimagine scholarly communications; to return to the non-commercial essence
of science that favours epistemic, methodological, linguistic, geographic and
content bibliodiversity; and to rectify some of the existing biases and
inequalities in the system. Open scholarship has the potential to help us
address these wicked problems in entirely new ways by breaking down disciplinary
boundaries, fostering new, radically open research methods, and expanding the
reach of research far beyond the academy. But we also must go beyond the
discussion of simply open vs closed. When we talk about decolonizing scholarly
communications, we must avoid focusing on the dichotomy of opening or closing
access to published science. Rather, the discussion should be about who controls
or will control scholarly publishing, who dictates or will dictate the agendas,
where the economic investments will be made — especially where public resources
will be — and what new restrictions will be created with new OA models. All
these issues are of great importance if we are to achieve bibliodiversity and
sustainable, inclusive scholarly communications.

## Conclusion: Building Inclusive Open Access Infrastructures

One of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals is to ‘build resilient
infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster
innovation’[^5]. Local scholarly communications infrastructures allow for
central governance of policies, procedures and controls, but are intentionally
decentralized to support the development of local capacity and infrastructure,
ensuring greater sustainability and alignment with local policies and
priorities. By valuing and supporting local infrastructures and services,
scholarly communications can take advantage of the widespread adoption of
information and communication technologies to be more inclusive. The publishing
sector in developing countries has the opportunity to optimize its processes to
make scientific communications sustainable and competitive, and even to endure
the voracious commercial strategies through which OA is being advanced in
developed countries.

    https://[www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/infrastructure-industrialization/]()

How can we begin to build more diversity in the system? We believe that this
will require radically rethinking how we assign value to, and invest in,
different types of research infrastructures and services, and will only take
place if we coordinate and link two simultaneous efforts: (1) to develop new,
sustainable funding models for a diverse range of services and publications; and
(2) to adopt research assessment measures that incentivize researchers to
publish in these venues. Bibliodiversity, by its nature, cannot be pursued
through a single, unified approach. It starts with recognition and respect for
differences and idiosyncrasies, and with an acceptance that bibliodiversity
implies the challenge of connecting diverse services, outputs and perspectives,
and fostering their development. This requires significant intentionality and
coordination in order to avoid a fragmented system or a growth in
centralization. As a first step, we are proposing the adoption of national
and/or organizational strategies for scholarly communications, with
bibliodiversity and openness as key underlying principles, as mechanisms for
developing cohesive approaches that foster healthy scholarly communications by
ensuring sustainable funding and incentives. If we do not act now, it is
possible that this opportunity will be lost, along with the bibliodiversity
needed to ensure that research thrives and can address every society’s most
pressing problems.
